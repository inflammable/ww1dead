#WW1Dead

##An HTML/JS visualisation of New Zealand casualies during World War 1

Each soldier/block represents a single person from this list. The list is organised alphabetically by surname, though names are not included.

[See a preview](http://dev.raromachine.com/ww1/).

##The data

The data for this was sourced from the [Commonwealth War Graves (CWGC) website](http://www.cwgc.org), the actual data included is a list of the death dates converted to an unsorted Javascript array.

##Technical stuff

This was built using [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) though a built version is included in the `./dist` folder.

In order to reinstall the components needed to run the various grunt commands available via Yeoman, you'll need to install NodeJS (with npm) and Bower run `npm install && bower install`.
